 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.594   TIME= 15:54:53
 Shape testing revealed that 2 of the 186 new or modified elements       
 violate shape warning limits.  To review test results, please see the   
 output file or issue the CHECK command.                                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      14.531   TIME= 15:57:24
 Previous testing revealed that 2 of the 322 selected elements violate   
 shape warning limits.  To review warning messages, please see the       
 output or error file, or issue the CHECK command.                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      14.734   TIME= 15:57:27
 The program chosen initial timestep/load-factor is arbitrary.  It is    
 necessary for the user to supply a suitable initial                     
 timestep/load-factor through the NSUB or DELTIM command for             
 convergence and overall efficiency.                                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      14.938   TIME= 15:57:29
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.38 is defined in the model.  Switch to   
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.

 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 0 is less than a threshold.  This   
 threshold is internally calculated.  You can overwrite it by            
 specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check results carefully.
